My name is César Leblanc, I am 25 years old and I am a third year PhD student at Inria and University of Montpellier working on artificial intelligence and biodiversity.
For my work, I have a strong interest in applied machine/deep learning, programming in Python, and reproducible research and open science.
Other personal interests include but are not limited to plants (especially trying to keep mine alive), cinéma (mostly silent black and white Hungarian movies from the 1930s that last 5 hours), and music (pretending to listen to everything but in reality having almost only playlists made entirely of French rap).

PhD
======
My PhD is entitled "Predicting future biodiversity trajectories using machine learning".
The goal of my work is to combine multiple sources (e.g., species observations, satellite images, and environmental rasters) to predict plant assemblages in a given location and time, and then derive habitat types and several biodiversity indicators (e.g., species richness, presence of invasive or threatened species, and ecosystem health indicators).
My research leverages both computer vision (convolutional neural networks) and natural language processing (transformers) to integrate multiple biodiversity data streams.
In particular, I am focusing on the three following points:

1. training and evaluating deep learning algorithms for the (very) high resolution mapping of species (see [framework](https://github.com/plantnet/malpolon) and [paper](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3180/paper-169.pdf))
2. creating a foundation model capable of getting a syntaxic understanding of plant species assemblages (see [framework](https://github.com/) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/))
3. using the predicted species to map and monitor European habitats, while providing biodiversity indicators (work in progress)

In addition to the papers and frameworks mentionned above, the main results of the PhD can directly be observed on the [GeoPl@ntNet platform](https://maps.plantnet.org/viewer/). Since the beginning of the PhD in 2022, my results have been published in 12 academic papers or working notes, presented in 4 conferences or congresses, and introduced in 4 seminars or talks.
